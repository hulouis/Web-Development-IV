Option B1: Take the flashlight and venture into the hallway.

I’d choose the path to the right leading to the old bridge. I am going to take the flashlight and ventures into the hallway, because there is something intriguing about the combination of an ancient structure and thick fog—it suggests mystery, a crossing between the familiar and the unknown inccident. While it may be risky, i will cross the bridge to make sure there is no danger around the mountains while being scared and make sure is safe for others to pass.

What about you? Which would you choose, and why?
