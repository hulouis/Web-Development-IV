# Choose Your Own Adventure

You are walking along a mountain path when suddenly you hear a loud noise. Looking up, you notice a strange light in the distant sky. You feel a sense of curiosity but also some unease.

Ahead, you have four choices:

- **The path to the left**: This path leads into a dense forest where the light is dim, and you can't see what's ahead.
- **The path to the right**: This path leads to an old bridge, with the other side shrouded in thick fog.
- **Turn back**: You can choose to return the way you came, back to familiar ground and avoid any unknown dangers.
- **Stay where you are**: Perhaps you decide to wait and see if something happens or if someone appears.

Which path will you choose? Please explain the reason for your choice.
